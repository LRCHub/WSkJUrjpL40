안 봐도 보여 what is on your mind
내가 봐도 난 좀 quite so fine
왜 자꾸 내 곁에 like my wallet in my back pocket
I'm your bad habit, yeah you want me and you
can't stop it
What am I to do?
Tell me baby, wanna come tonight?
시작도 전에 did I make you cry?
몸은 low, 소리는 make it high
When I talk to you
When I talk to you
When I talk to you
넌 날 원해
훤히 보여 don't lie
이미 다 알아
When I talk to you
Talk to you
넌 날 원해
Talk to you
훤히 보여 don't lie
Talk to you
이미 다 알아
Baby, when I talk to you
You stay up all night, think of me 또 넌 내 앞에
풀어 달래 what you really want me to unlock it
계속 타오르려고만 해 마치 넌 rocket
마치 rocket 마치 rocket 마치
Oh, that girl's on fire
식힐 땐 pourin' some water
When I talk to you 말 안 해도 너의
Hair, skin, nails, face 내게 다 반응해
Tell me baby, wanna come tonight?
시작도 전에 did I make you cry?
몸은 low, 소리는 make it high
When I talk to you
When I talk to you
When I talk to you
넌 날 원해
훤히 보여 don't lie
이미 다 알아
When I talk to you
Talk to you
넌 날 원해
Talk to you
훤히 보여 don't lie
Talk to you
이미 다 알아
Baby, when I talk to you
알아 멈추기 싫지 넌 더 wanna play
그럼 더 크게 call my name
When I talk to you
When I talk to you
When I talk to you
When I'm talkin' to you
When I talk to you
