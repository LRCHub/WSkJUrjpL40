You've been turning every head again
Tonight out on the town
I'm not the best at this at standing out
Within a crowd i just shut down

And everyone here's competing over who will catch your eye
No i don't blame them none for i am one
Within the fray your starry sky

And i should make small talk and keep it light yeah be polite
Cuz you're not the only one here

But i just wanna talk to you
To hear all your stories the glories and shame
I just wanna talk to you
To know where you're going the choices you've made
I just wanna walk thru your highways and byways and valleys between
Everything that brought you right here to me

Room's spinning seventh inning stretching out to catch a sign
I feel electrified i look to find
Your liquid eyes are fixed on mine

Truth is i didn't come tonight to see or be seen
I wanna spill the beans and drink your wine
Download your feed and share your time

And just a while longer now maybe we can finally leave
Somewhere we can hear every word

Cause i just wanna talk to you
To hear all your stories the glories and shame
I just wanna talk to you
To know where you're going the places you've been
I just wanna walk thru your highways and byways and valleys between
Everything that brought you right here to me

You've broken me open cracked a shell i didn't know i had
How long's it been since i forgot to miss
The one who came before all this

I just wanna talk to you
To trace back the pages
From your side of space...
I just wanna talk to you
To know where you're going, the choices you've made
I just wanna walk thru your highways and byways and valleys between
Everything that brought you right here to me
Everything that brought you right here to me
