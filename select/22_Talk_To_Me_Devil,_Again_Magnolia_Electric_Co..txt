Roll the moon over my heart
Roll my heart out with the tide
I talked to the wolf in the mountain
And I talked to the mule in the mine
Devil unwind what's empty
Devil unwind my heart
Devil make the two ends meet
Devil when I fall
Talk to me devil, again
Talk to me devil, again
Talk to me devil, again
Baby I still have time
Smell the lightning burning the starry sky
Rhododendron now under the moon
All hearts still in the tide
Devil if I fall hold out no water to me
Devil when I fall, hold out no hand
Devil unwind what's empty
Devil unbind my heart
Devil make the two ends meet
Devil if I fall apart
Talk to me devil, again
Talk to me devil, again
Talk to me devil, again
Baby I still have time
